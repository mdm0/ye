What does Ye say

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, Michael and I created programs to randomly select from Kanye's tweets and lyrics, and then he combined them. He followed a tutorial to create a Discord bot to use these tweets and lyrics as a response. Michael then followed another tutorial to add AI to the discord bot. The website was also developed and looks very good and functions so far. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still need to create a program to censor some of the lyrics and tweets, and record the demo video. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We had some trouble getting the program to function on another device that wasn't Michael's computer. But so far, everything else seems to be working in our favor.
