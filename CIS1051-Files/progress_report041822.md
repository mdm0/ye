# 04/18/22 Progress Report on Ye Say
## The Good
I combined my work with Abby's and followed a [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/) to turn our datasets into a chat bot that delivers a random Kanye tweet or lyric.  

Ye Say's [website](https://yesay.netlify.app) also looks fantastic. It runs off of Netlify and GitHub Pages.
