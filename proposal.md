# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"What does Ye Say?"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Discord bot that, when prompted for advice, will display a random Kanye West Tweet or song lyric as advice that obviously isn't helpful.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We are first going to make a discord bot account and create a bot for the project. We will compile an excel sheet of 50 tweets and song lyrics of Kanye West, and then write a code that will randomly select from either the song lyrics or tweets to be used as responses from the bot. We will also create a corresponding website that offers "advice" from Kanye, but will similarly give quotes from his songs or tweets once prompted. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Michael Miano - mdm@temple.edu (TA: Hongzheng Wang)
Abby Rakowski - abigail.rakowski@temple.edu (TA: Sky Gao)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

If the website fails or becomes too complicated to work with, we will at least have the functioning bot. Also, if having two documents to select from alters the funcionality of the code, then we may choose either just tweets or just song lyrics as responses from the bot.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The discord bot works well displaying both lyrics and tweets and gives the user a good laugh, while the website is also functional but may have a few flaws. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Both the bot and the website work perfectly, and people can seek advice from Kanye West humself.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn how to import excel sheets and have the code print the entire row of an ecxel sheet, not just one cell. We also will need to know how to write a code that will choose from either of the spreadsheets of data, not just one or the other. We also will need to familiarize ourselves with discord bots, as neither of us are very experienced in creating discord bots. We will also need to learn how to change the fonts and colors of the outputs for the website and the bot so that it looks more appealing and fits better with its setting.
