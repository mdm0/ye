"
Kanye,"'Cause I'm comin' home again
"
Kanye,"Do you think about me now and then? Oh!

"
Kanye,"My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
"
Kanye,"Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
"
Kanye,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
"
Kanye,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
"
Kanye,"It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
"

"
Kanye,"J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
"
Kanye,"Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
"
Kanye,"Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
"
Kanye,"Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
"
Kanye,"With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
"
Kanye,"At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
"
Kanye,"But he got me out my momma crib
"
Kanye,"Then he help me get my momma a crib
"
Kanye,"Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
"
Kanye,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
"
Kanye,"Let the story begin
"
Kanye,"If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
"
Kanye,"Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
"
Kanye,"Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
"
Kanye,"'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
"
Kanye,"And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
"
Kanye,"I'd play my little songs in that old back room
"
Kanye,"He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
"
Kanye,"But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
"
Kanye,"Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
"
Kanye,"Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
"
Kanye,"And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
"
Kanye,"Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
"
Kanye,"Carline told me I could buy two tickets
"
Kanye,"I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
"
Kanye,"And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
"
Kanye,"But everything that I felt was more bogus
"
Kanye,"Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
"
Kanye,"Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
"
Kanye,"I guess I'll understand when I get more older
"
Kanye,"Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
"
Kanye,"Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
"
Kanye,"Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
"
Kanye,"Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
"
Kanye,"The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
"
Kanye,"I was always on the other side of the peephole
"
Kanye,"Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
"
Kanye,"And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
"
Kanye,"But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
"
Kanye,"On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
"
Kanye,"Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
"
Kanye,"Sibling rivalry, only I could see
"
Kanye,"It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
"
Kanye,"At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
"
Kanye,"But my big brother who I always tried to be
"
Kanye,"When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
"
Kanye,"Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
"
Kanye,"I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
"
Kanye,"And my shit was more like a finger roll
"
Kanye,"But I had them singles though
"
Kanye,"And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
"
Kanye,"I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
"
Kanye,"Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
"
Kanye,"Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
"
Kanye,"Translate, español: ""No way, José""
"
Kanye,"Then I went and told Jay Brown
"
Kanye,"Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
"
Kanye,"Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
"
Kanye,"But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
"
Kanye,"So here's a few words from ya kid brother
"
Kanye,"If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
"
Kanye,"People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
"
Kanye,"A idol in my eyes, god of the game

Kanye,"Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
"
Kanye,"Me and my grandparents on a field trip
"
Kanye,"And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
"
Kanye,"But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
"
Kanye,"Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
"
Kanye,"Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
"
Kanye,"What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
"
Kanye,"What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?

Kanye,"And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
"
Kanye,"It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to

Kanye,"You're gonna be the death of me
"
Kanye,"I don't want you, but I need you
"
Kanye,"I love you and hate you at the very same time
"
Kanye,"See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
"
Kanye,"Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
"
Kanye,"We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
"
Kanye,"God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
"
Kanye,"And she claims she only with me for the currency
"
Kanye,"You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
"
Kanye,"And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
"
Kanye,"I'd never do that to you, at least purposely

Kanye,"We breaking up again, we making up again
"
Kanye,"But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
"
Kanye,"Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
"
Kanye,"And you mix them emotions with tequila

Kanye,"And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
"
Kanye,"And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch""
"
Kanye,"You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude

Kanye,"Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
"
Kanye,"And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny

Kanye,"Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
"
Kanye,"Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
"
Kanye,"So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
"
Kanye,"Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
"
Kanye,"Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
"
Kanye,"So won't you raise your glass won't you
"
Kanye,"And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""
"
Kanye,"No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""
"
Kanye,"I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
"
Kanye,"I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
"
Kanye,"I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""
"
Kanye,"And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""
"
Kanye,"And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said
"
Kanye,"""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""
"
Kanye,"And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...
"
Kanye,"...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...
"
Kanye,"...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
"
Kanye,"And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""
"
Kanye,"I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
"
Kanye,"Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""
"
Kanye,"Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
"
Kanye,"""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
"
Kanye,"I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
"
Kanye,"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""
"
Kanye,"""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""
"
Kanye,"Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""
"
Kanye,"""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""
"
Kanye,"And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""
"
Kanye,"So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
"
Kanye,"So won't you raise your glass, won't you..."
